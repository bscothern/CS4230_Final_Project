Our project source is originally from: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~msgsss/factor/qs_rep.pdf


Compilation:
	You can use run make to compile all 3 versions of our program.

	factor_seq		- is the sequential and original version of the program.
	factor_par		- is the parallel version that we got working.
	factor_broken	- is the far more parallel implementation that we worked on but we never got working properly.

	-r <b>		Factor a random number with b bits. [NUMBER] will be ignored if given.
	-R <b>		Factor a random semiprime with b bits. [Number] will be ignored if given.
